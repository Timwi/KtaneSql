                <h2>On the Subject of SQL - Basic</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">How fun is it to ride through a large table of numbers to find similarities...</p>

                <p>This module is a SQL code simulator that you have to defuse by producing the proper SQL query based on the expected output that the module provides you with and the documented input. In the module, you will find 3 distinct sections to build SQL which are described below. You will also find a <strong>Goal</strong> button and a <strong>Check</strong> button.</p>

                <h2>Operation</h2>
                <p>Press on the <strong>Goal</strong> button to show you what is expected by the module. The expectation is a matrix of numbers such as below. The result can be from 1 to 4 rows and 2 to 3 columns, for example:</p>

                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-around; align-content: flex-start;">
                    <table style="align-self: flex-start;">
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr>
                    </table>
                    <table style="align-self: flex-start;">
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    </table>
                    <table style="align-self: flex-start;">
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>7</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    </table>
                    <table style="align-self: flex-start;">
                        <tr><td>2</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This matrix is extracted from the input below using an SQL query. You craft the SQL query by clicking on the different buttons to cycle through the possible values in each button.</p>

                <p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not know what SQL is, refer to the sections below to learn how to build SQL queries.</blockquote></p>

                <p>Pressing on the <strong>Check</strong> button tries to solve the module by computing a result from the crafted SQL. The crafted SQL doesn't need to be exactly the one used to generate the goal, as long as it generates the same result it's fine. If you do not provide proper SQL, you will generate a strike. When in goal mode, the <strong>Goal</strong> button changes to an <strong>Editor</strong> button so you can go back to the SQL editor.</p>

                <h3>On the subject of SQL</h3>
                <p>SQL is a programming language that describes how to manipulate sources of data and generate a difference output source. It is comprised of many different keywords, only a minimal list is used in this module.</p>

                <h4>How SQL is processed</h4>
                <p>SQL is processed always in the same way:<p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Each row is compared against the filters. (The WHERE clause) If a row complies with the filter expression it is kept for further processing.</li>
                        <li>Each row that passes the filter expression is then processed against the selection expressions. (The SELECT clause) The first SELECT expression is what goes in the first column of the ouput. If you use G as the first SELECT expression, the values of the G column go into the first column of the result.</li>
                        <li>Finaly, each row of the end result is processed against the LIMIT clause, that is skip M amount of rows from the result and then keep only N lines after that.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h4>SELECT</h4>
                <p>SELECT X, Y, Z</p>
                <p>When you select something, you choose to take all the values that match this X, Y or Z expression and return it. The module offers 3 possible return expressions and they are always simple column references. You must click to select each column to return, you can select between A and G and disable the selection when it shows a "-".</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Columns are not always returned in alphabetic order, it could be: A, G then E.</p>

        <div class="page page-bg-01">
            <div class="page-header">
                <span class="page-header-doc-title">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod</span>
                <span class="page-header-section-title">SQL - Basic</span>
            </div>
            <div class="page-content">

                <h4>WHERE</h4>
                <p>WHERE X operation Z</p>
                <p>WHERE introduces a filter, all rows will be tested against the conditions you provide the module with and will be included if they match those conditions. The SQL module makes it simple for you, you can only compare columns to fixed values, that means, you can select a column between A and G on the left side and select a value between 0 and 9 on the right side. The possible operators are all simple mathematical operators that you probably already know such as:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equals or "="</li>
                        <li>Not equals or "&lt;&gt;"</li>
                        <li>Less than or "<"</li>
                        <li>Less than or equal or "<="</li>
                        <li>Greather than or ">"</li>
                        <li>Greather than or equal or ">="</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If you think you need 2 conditions to achieve the result, click on the button below the WHERE label to introduce a 2nd filter. You can choose between AND and OR to connect the two filters. AND means both conditions must pass to keep the row, OR means at least one condition must pass to keep the row.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You must always specify at least 1 filter.</p>

                <h4>LIMIT</h4>
                <p>LIMIT n, o</p>
                <p>LIMIT comes with two values. For simplicity, the SQL module splits them for you in two selectors:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limit: Indicates the number of rows to keep from the matching results after apply conditions. If you select "All", no rows are discarded.</li>
                        <li>Skip: Indicates the number of rows to skip after applying conditions. If you select "None", no rows are discarded.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
